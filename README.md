## Built Upon & Related Work

This repository  is built on previous outstanding works:

- ðŸ”— **[SGMSE]**-https://github.com/sp-uhh/sgmse

- ðŸ”— **[StoRM]**-https://github.com/sp-uhh/storm

- ðŸ”— **[FlowMSE]**-https://github.com/seongq/flowmse

**Note**: This work extends the above method through a one-step generation framework while retaining the complex STFT-based front-end data processing design.

## Pretrained Checkpoints (Coming Soon)

We will provide pretrained checkpoints trained on the **VoiceBank-DEMAND** dataset in the near future.
> **Stay tuned!** We will update this section as soon as the checkpoint is ready for public release.
