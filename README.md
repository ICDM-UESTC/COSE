# Compose Yourself: Average-Velocity Flow Matching for One-Step Speech Enhancement
This is the implementation of [Compose Yourself: Average-Velocity Flow Matching for One-Step Speech Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15952).

## Environment Requirements
```
# create virtual environment
conda create --name COSE python=3.9.0

# activate environment
conda activate COSE

# install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How to train
```
python train.py --log_dir <path_to_model> --base_dir <path_to_dataset>
```
## How to Run Inference

To enhance noisy speech using a trained checkpoint, run:

```bash
python enhancement.py \
    --test_dir <path_to_noisy> \
    --enhanced_dir <path_to_enhanced> \
    --ckpt <path_to_model_checkpoint>

## How to Compute Evaluation Metrics


```bash
python calc_metrics.py \
    --clean_dir <path_to_clean> \
    --noisy_dir <path_to_noisy> \
    --enhanced_dir <path_to_enhanced>



## Pretrained Checkpoints (Coming Soon)

We will provide pretrained checkpoints trained on the **VoiceBank-DEMAND** dataset in the near future.
> **Stay tuned!** We will update this section as soon as the checkpoint is ready for public release.
